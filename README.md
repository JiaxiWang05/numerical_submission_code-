### Running the Code

To execute the main code and explore the tasks, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JiaxiWang05/numerical_submission_code.git
   cd numerical_submission_code
   ```

2. Set up the required environment (if applicable):
   ```bash
   # For MATLAB, ensure you have it installed and configured.
   ```

3. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   # In MATLAB, run:
   main_code;
   ```

4. Explore individual task folders for further details and additional scripts.

### Report Details
